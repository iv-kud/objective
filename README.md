## Objective Operating System

## Install dependencies

#### Ubuntu

```sh
sudo apt update -y
sudo apt -y install build-essential binutils nasm xorriso grub-common qemu-system-i386 mtools
```

You need to build GCC cross compiler for i686 or x86_64 supports x32 architecture/s to compile from sources.
Also required gcc and stdc++ libraries.
Refer to GCC documentation for detailed information - <https://gcc.gnu.org/install/>

## Build and run

Before build the project set some variables - DEBUG and LIBS_PATH.  
These variables may pass through *make* command `make *variables* *rule*`, or usage environment variables `export *name*=*value*`.

#### Variables

1. DEBUG. Not takes value. If define–≤, the debug version of the project will be build, otherwise the release version. Responsible for the debug version of the project to test OS via GDB.
2. LIBS_PATH. Takes the path to the required libraries. Now gcc library is required, supplied with the compiled.

#### Ubuntu

Build and run release version
```sh
cmake -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=../toolchain.cmake ..
make run
```

Build and run debug version
```sh
make debug
make gdb
```
or
```sh
export DEBUG=*
make all
```
